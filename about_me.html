                    <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                    <p>I love to learn new things and new skills. Feeling that I am developing and not standing still is very important for me. With Scrimba I have found a really good platform - the practical knowledge is provided in small chunks and is accompanied by lot of practical exercises and solo projects. The challenge is to allocate enough time every day and keep the pace, otherwise freshly acquired knowledge may be easily forgotten. I am quite satisfied with my progress so far - as within 2 months I will gave gone through 50% of the programme, however I am still thinking of re-arranging my daily routines, to be able to spend 6-7 hours daily on learning & coding. </p>
                    
                    <h2>How I got started</h2>
                    <p>I have been always fond of computers. When I was teenager in late 80ties, I had my own Atari 520ST. Later on in the beginning of my professional career in the Commercial Department, my computer literacy helped me to stand out, as I developed tools in MsAccess and Excel that largely increased productivity. I have been responsible of succesful ERP (SAP) implementation in the commercial& logistics areas of the big cement plant. The reputation I gained, helped me in further promotions to high positions like VP Commercial and MD/CEO, but the downside was that I lost for a time a direct connection with IT. In mid 2021 - I decided to quit my job, in the search of the new way of living with more time for my family and myself. In the Autumn of 2022 I red an article about the possibilities of entering the tech-industry without formal degree but just with the skills. I jumped into it, starting with completion of some basic courses of JS, SQL and HTML/CSS on KhanAcademy and shortly after I discovered Scrimba which I find much better and more up to date. I am now participating in Front End Developer Career Path</p>
